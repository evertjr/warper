# Warper

An open-source research playground exploring GPU-accelerated, color-managed image warping in the browser. Warper blends modern WebGL, React Compiler and ICC-aware pipelines to prototype new approaches to non-linear image manipulation.

The goal: **push what's possible in client-side imaging while keeping the code approachable for curious developers, artists and researchers alike**.
